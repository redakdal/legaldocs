WE assert that we have made many attemps to contact the copyright owners of this build,regarding the uncompleted game and future use of it, but have yet to hear back from them in 2 years since everyone who was a holder, is under a strict Nda that prevents them from giving us consent to share this, though no known consent was ever implied to anyone that had it prior to 2018.The law states the copyright owners must make a attempt to protect their inteutal properties as copyright for software has also been in a legal grey area, that is based on legal actions that may or may not happen. We also do not have to comply with the license for elements of the material as no known license exists within the build source that prevent us or anyone from sharing anything that is in this build. it should be noted that I got games filed for a dissolve and wind up of Nerd Kingdom inc in may of 2019 that officially states they do not exist as a enity anymore.There is no public information on who owns the copyright for TUG and all  of it assets, and no one has stepped forword since 2018 to announce that they had them, this being said we reserve the right with creative commons and other legal right to share this build until stated otherwise in a court of law.
