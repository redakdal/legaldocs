YOU MUST DO THIS IN ORDER FOR TUG TO LOAD SINGLEPLAYER, IF YOU DO NOT DO THE STEPS ABOVE THE GAME WILL CRASH TO DESKTOP


1. Extract the TUG folder to the drive you plan to launch the game from.
2. Open the TUG folder.
3. Open the Config folder.
4. Edit the "user_config.txt" file. 

5. Replace <USERNAME> with your computer profile name in the following locations of the user_config.txt file:

(you can find this out by searching RUN on your pc and typing C:\users and it will take you to the directory of users on your pc):
	CLIENTCACHEPATH = "C:/Users/<USERNAME>/AppData/Roaming/Nerd Kingdom/TUG/ClientCache/"

	FULLSAVEPATH = "C:/Users/<USERNAME>/AppData/Roaming/Nerd Kingdom/TUG/Saves/"

it should look something like this: "C:/Users/peter/AppData/Roaming/Nerd Kingdom/TUG/Saves/"
C:/Users/peter/AppData/Roaming/Nerd Kingdom/TUG/Saves/"

please note : they do not contain < or > should be the exact same as your profile name on your pc

6. Save the "user_config.txt" file.
7. Launch TUG.exe

if you still crash after doing all this above, you must maunally make them in order to play TUG, we will fix this in the future but for now this must be done in order for TUG to save and run.


TIP: Be sure to adjust the Video settings under the Options menu, before you start a new game. TUG graphics can be very resource intensive and should be changed according to individual system specs.
                                         
                                             4. To-do list
 The modding community is trying to get the MOA and Golems working as the Nerd Kingdom dev team never got around to it, they have decided it would be great to get these tier rewards working in game for everyone

 

                                               5. Status

Officially TUG game was abandoned at the end of 2015, they toke the game off the steam store and planned to move it to Opengl as they were bought out by IGG in 2016, though at the end of 2017 that project failed due to a internal test, and while Nerdkingdom is offically gone as of may 16 29, we hope that by releasing this, their work won't be forgotton and can be continued or added upon


                                              6. Inspiration

the backers, the players and others of the community that came back to help us, and everyone else that worked on TUG and TUGv2.0, I and others shared this because we were inspired by all the work that was done on it, and how much of a shame no one got to see and play it, well until now!!
